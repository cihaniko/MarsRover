# MarsRover
Case Project 

  Default parameters were used in the project. 
  To view and change parameters, take a look at the "main" function in "program.cs"
  It gives exception when going out of range.

For example Robotic Rover Direction.
  ```
     Location rover1 = new Location()
      {
          X = 1,
          Y = 2,
          Direction = "N"
      };
      mr.RoboticRoversDirection(rover1, "LMLMLMLMM");
```
